# Taco Truck Webpage
## About the Page
This was my first solo project while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm very proud of all the knowledge I gained while building this page. It was a struggle to start, 
but as I continuted to learn in my bootcamp, I was able to implement what I was learning. I LOVE tacos so I made a ***fake*** webpage advertising a taco truck business. There
are some fillers on the page just so I could see how everything would look. Feel free to have a look by clicking the link below.
